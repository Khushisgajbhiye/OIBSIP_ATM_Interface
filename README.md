# OIBSIP_ATM_Interface
In this project, we will be building an ATM console application using Java. The application will prompt the user for their user ID and PIN, and upon successful authentication, it will provide various functionalities such as transaction history, withdrawal, deposit, transfer, and quitting the application.
